# Chat-MultiThreat
School project

The goal was to create a network based  multithreaded client-server chat app.

Chatters establish a connection with the server and can do the following :


    Create a profile (login, password) and save it
    login
    List topics
    create topics
    join topics
    send messages to all chatters on a specific topic
